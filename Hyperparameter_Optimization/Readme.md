Hyperparameter optimization is the processing of choosing the optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm. It helps to determine the combination of hyperparameters that gives a model it's best performance. The values of the hyperparameters control the learning proccess of the learning algorithm. Various techniques including Grid search, Random Search, Bayesian optimization, Evolutionary optimization, and population-based are used for hyperparameter optimization.
